# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Description: Session Hijacking.
In the GIF, the user manually logs into the blue website on a first browser (Chrome) and copies the generated PHPSESSIONID that was gathered from that login onto a separate browser (FireFox). The malicious third party was able to then log into the blue web page without ever needing to impact their own account credentials.
